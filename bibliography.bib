	abstract = {Many large social networks are a complex combination of smaller groups or subgraphs. Identifying groups within a network and mapping their relationship to one another can be essential to making intelligent strategic decisions. Network analysis can help identify competing or complementary groups, potential allies to form a powerful group, and individuals who can connect one to a new group. Identifying and visualizing groups is also a powerful strategy for making sense of large networks. Social network analysis provides a set of tools for identifying and understanding groups, also called clusters or communities by network researchers. In the language of network analysis, clusters are pockets of densely connected vertices that are only sparsely connected to other pockets. One of the powers of social network analysis is that it can be used to automatically identify clusters that one may not have known to look for ahead of time. These naturally occurring clusters are based on patterns of social ties rather than formal group memberships. This chapter describes how clusters can be identified and visualized in NodeXL.},

Dr. L is a graph layout program that uses a multilevel force-directed algorithm. A graph is input and drawn using a force-directed algorithm based on simulated annealing. The resulting layout is clustered using a single link algorithm. This clustering is used to produce a coarsened graph (fewer nodes) which is then re-drawn. this process is repeated until a sufficiently small graph is produced. The smallest graph is drawn and then used as a basis for drawing the original graph by refining the series of coarsened graphs that were produced. The layout engine can be run in serial or in parallel.},

	abstract = {Networks are proving to be central to the study of gene function, protein–protein interaction, and biochemical pathway data. Visualization of networks is important for their study, but visualization tools are often inadequate for working with very large biological networks. Here, we present an algorithm, called large graph layout (LGL), which can be used to dynamically visualize large networks on the order of hundreds of thousands of vertices and millions of edges. LGL applies a force-directed iterative layout guided by a minimal spanning tree of the network in order to generate coordinates for the vertices in two or three dimensions, which are subsequently visualized and interactively navigated with companion programs. We demonstrate the use of LGL in visualizing an extensive protein map summarizing the results of ∼21 billion sequence comparisons between 145,579 proteins from 50 genomes. Proteins are positioned in the map according to sequence homology and gene fusions, with the map ultimately serving as a theoretical framework that integrates inferences about gene function derived from sequence homology, remote homology, gene fusions, and higher-order fusions. We confirm that protein neighbors in the resulting map are functionally related, and that distinct map regions correspond to distinct cellular systems, enabling a computational strategy for discovering proteins' functions on the basis of the proteins' map positions. Using the map produced by LGL, we infer general functions for 23 uncharacterized protein families. LGL is freely available (at http://bioinformatics.icmb.utexas.edu/lgl).},

	abstract = {Network meta-analysis (NMA) has become an increasingly used tool to compare multiple treatments simultaneously by synthesizing direct and indirect evidence in clinical research. However, many existing studies did not properly report the evidence of treatment comparisons and show the comparison structure to audience. In addition, nearly all treatment networks presented only direct evidence, not overall evidence that can reflect the benefit of performing NMAs. This article classifies treatment networks into three types under different assumptions; they include networks with each treatment comparison's edge width proportional to the corresponding number of studies, sample size, and precision. In addition, three new measures (ie, the effective number of studies, the effective sample size, and the effective precision) are proposed to preliminarily quantify overall evidence gained in NMAs. They permit audience to intuitively evaluate the benefit of performing NMAs, compared with pairwise meta-analyses based on only direct evidence. We use four case studies, including one illustrative example, to demonstrate their derivations and interpretations. Treatment networks may look fairly differently when different measures are used to present the evidence. The proposed measures provide clear information about overall evidence of all treatment comparisons, and they also imply the additional number of studies, sample size, and precision obtained from indirect evidence. Some comparisons may benefit little from NMAs. Researchers are encouraged to present overall evidence of all treatment comparisons, so that audience can preliminarily evaluate the quality of NMAs.},

We have also examined the effect of increasing the number of partitions on the total computation time.

	abstract = {This paper presents a new spectral partitioning formulation which directly incorporates vertex size information by modifying the Laplacian of the graph. Modifying the Laplacian produces a generalized eigenvalue problem, which is reduced to the standard eigenvalue problem. Experiments show that the scaled ratio-cut costs of results on benchmarks with arbitrary vertex size improve by 22\% when the eigenvectors of the Laplacian in the spectral partitioner KP are replaced by the eigenvectors of our modified Laplacian. The inability to handle vertex sizes in the spectral partitioning formulation has been a limitation in applying spectral partitioning in a multilevel setting. We investigate whether our new formulation effectively removes this limitation by combining it with a simple multilevel bottom-up clustering algorithm and an iterative improvement algorithm for partition refinement. Experiments show that in a multilevel setting where the spectral partitioner KP provides the initial partitions of the most contracted graph, using the modified Laplacian in place of the standard Laplacian is more efficient and more effective in the partitioning of graphs with arbitrary-size and unit-size vertices; average improvements of 17\% and 18\% are observed for graphs with arbitrary-size and unit-size vertices, respectively. Comparisons with other ratio-cut based partitioners on hypergraphs with unit-size as well as arbitrary-size vertices, show that the multilevel spectral partitioner produces either better results or almost identical results more efficiently.},
